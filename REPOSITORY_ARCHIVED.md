# Repository Archived - Project Transformed

## Project Evolution Complete

This repository has been **transformed and migrated** to a new dedicated repository:

**New Location**: https://github.com/giovanto/Amsterdam-Noord-Flights

## Transformation Summary

**Original Purpose**: Fork of `adsblol/globe_history_2024` for historical flight data downloads

**Final Evolution**: Multi-dimensional aviation impact analysis system for environmental justice research

## What Was Migrated

✅ **Complete System Architecture**:
- Real-time flight data collection (500+ flights/hour)
- PostgreSQL analysis database with PostGIS support
- ETL pipeline with automated validation and monitoring
- Multi-dimensional correlation analysis framework

✅ **All Planning and Documentation**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development session guide and project context
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture and design decisions
- `HACKATHON_PROJECT_BRIEF.md` - Multi-dimensional analysis strategy
- `AGENT_BRIEFING.md` - Development priorities and research questions
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Operations guide and workflow documentation

✅ **Production System**:
- Deployed on Studio Bereikbaar infrastructure
- 1,971+ reliable flights collected
- Real-time monitoring and quality assurance
- Ready for Dutch Mobility Hackathon 2025

## Why the Migration

1. **Clean Break**: Remove all traces of original flight data distribution purpose
2. **Professional Portfolio**: Clean repository for showcasing technical work
3. **Clear Identity**: Name and structure clearly reflect the aviation analysis purpose
4. **Future Growth**: Independent development without historical baggage

## Repository Status

- **Current Repository**: Archived for reference
- **Active Development**: Moved to https://github.com/giovanto/Amsterdam-Noord-Flights
- **System Status**: Production-ready and actively collecting data
